#### Description
Find your way out of the labyrinth! Revel in the pseudo 3D created in a 2D graphical 
library for python! 3 Mazes, ambient sounds and music, only 7 minutes to find each door!
#### Synopsis
The final project of two semesters of Python. While taking advantage of the PyGame 
graphics library to create a game with music, sound and multiple levels, I made the 
lofty goal of a 2.5D Doom-esque game, of which I ended up making the entire algorithm 
and code. Using a simple raycasting technique and many sessions of tweaking to images
and angles, I was able to create an engine which can take ASCII created maps and 
images to create a 3D environment. Thanks to Dante and Thomas for sound, sprite
and documentation help (sorry for taking on so much work, I should have picked a 
project that better suited all of our skills).
